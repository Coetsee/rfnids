# Introduction \label{Introduction}

The purpose of this paper is to report on the implementation of a Random Forest (RF) algorithm for a classification-type problem, namely, to classify which individuals and households were more likely to lose their main source of income due to the coronavirus and subsequent lockdown in South Africa in March and April 2020. 

RF is well-suited for these types of problems

# Data  \label{Data}

This study utilises the first wave of the National Income Dynamics Study - Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey 2020 (NIDS-CRAM) dataset, a longitudinal telephonic household survey conducted by the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU) in April and May 2020. NIDS-CRAM investigates the various social and economic effects of the national lockdown implemented in March 2020, and more broadly, the consequences of the global pandemic on the South African context.

In total, the dataset consists of 21 features, which is reported in Table \ref{table} below, with 6838 observations for each feature. The main variable of interest is 'Income.Change' - a binary variable where a value of 1 indicates that the household has lost their main source of income, whilst 2 indicates that it has not. The question asked to respondents reads as : "Has your household lost its main source of income since the lockdown started on 27th March?"

## Missing Values and Transformations {-}

Some missing values are imputed using simple median-replacement, where the missing value is replaced with the median value computed on the rest of the data. This method is preferred for continuous variables, such as, in our case, household income. Furthermore, the median is preferred to the mean as one would expect there to be large outliers to the top of the income spectrum rather than the bottom, whilst the missing values are more likely to be households with a lower income. Furthermore, for the 'Employment.Type' feature, missing values are replaced by 0's to indicate 'unemployed', as this survey question was only asked to those who were employed. Those who refused to respond or did not know their main form of work, were indicated as missing and kept in the data. 

For the categorical variables, missing values are imputed in two steps: first, NAs are replaced by the most frequent level in the column, and second, missing values are then imputed in the predictor data by using the proximity matrix from a random forest
