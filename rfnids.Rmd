# --------- page margins:
margin: 2.3 # Sides
bottom: 2 # bottom
top: 2.5 # Top
HardSet_layout: TRUE # Hard-set the spacing of words in your document. This will stop LaTeX squashing text to fit on pages, e.g.
# This is done by hard-setting the spacing dimensions. Set to FALSE if you want LaTeX to optimize this for your paper.

# --------- Line numbers
linenumbers: FALSE # Used when submitting to journal

# ---------- References settings:
# You can download cls format here: https://www.zotero.org/ - simply search for your institution. You can also edit and save cls formats here: https://editor.citationstyles.org/about/
# Hit download, store it in Tex/ folder, and change reference below - easy.
bibliography: Tex/ref.bib       # Do not edit: Keep this naming convention and location.
csl: Tex/harvard-stellenbosch-university.csl # referencing format used.
# By default, the bibliography only displays the cited references. If you want to change this, you can comment out one of the following:
#nocite: '@*' # Add all items in bibliography, whether cited or not
# nocite: |  # add specific references that aren't cited
#  @grinold2000
#  @Someoneelse2010

# ---------- General:
RemovePreprintSubmittedTo: TRUE  # Removes the 'preprint submitted to...' at bottom of titlepage
Journal: "Journal of Finance"   # Journal that the paper will be submitting to, if RemovePreprintSubmittedTo is set to TRUE.
toc: FALSE                       # Add a table of contents
numbersections: TRUE             # Should sections (and thus figures and tables) be numbered?
fontsize: 11pt                  # Set fontsize
linestretch: 1.2                # Set distance between lines.
link-citations: TRUE            # This creates dynamic links to the papers in reference list.

### Adding additional latex packages:
# header-includes:
#    - \usepackage{colortbl} # Add additional packages here.

    fig_height: 3.5

<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

# Lets load in example data, and see how this can be stored and later called from your 'data' folder.
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
