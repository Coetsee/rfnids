# Purpose:

In this project, I attempt to implement and compare a Random Forest and simple GBM on the NIDS-CRAM wave 1 data. The purpose is to classify and predict the people/households who were most likely to lose their main source of income due to the lockdown implemented in March 2020. 

# Files:

# rfnids.rmd is the latex file that outputs the final knitted document.

# randomforest_income.Rmd is the primary script that includes wrangling, imputation and modelling.

# Figures are stored in figures folder and data within data folder. The primary full dataset is called full.csv, whilst the imputed dataset, with which analysis is done is callde imputed_full
