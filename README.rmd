# Purpose:

In this project, I attempt to implement a Random Forest on the NidsCram wave 1 data. The purpose is to classify and predict the people/households who were most likely to lose their main source of income due to the lockdown implemented in March 2020. 

# Files:

*rfnids.rmd is the write up file which creates the pdf report output. 

*wrangling.rmd is where a local sql database is created and data is cleaned.
